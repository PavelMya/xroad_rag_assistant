## 2 Overview

The certification services and timestamping services approved by the
X-Road governing agency provide trust services for the members of an
X-Road instance.

The approved trust services are described in the central server. The
information on the approved trust services is distributed to the
security servers as a part of the global configuration.

The security servers verify that the certificates, OCSP responses and timestamps 
used in the communication process between the X-Road members are provided 
by approved trust services.
