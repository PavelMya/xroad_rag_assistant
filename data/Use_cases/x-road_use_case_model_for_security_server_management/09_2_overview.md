## 2 Overview

Timestamping services are used to preserve the evidence value of the
messages exchanged over the X-Road (see \[UC-MESS\]). The timestamping
services used in a security server must be approved by the X-Road
governing agency.

TLS certificates are used for establishing TLS connections with the
security server client's information systems if the “HTTPS” connection
method is chosen for the client's servers.

Signing certificates are used for signing X-Road messages.
Authentication certificates are used for establishing secure data
exchange channels between the security servers.

Backing up the system configuration ensures that in case of system
failure, the system configuration can be restored to a previously backed
up state.
