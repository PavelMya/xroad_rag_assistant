    responsible for managing the security server.

-   **CS administrator** (central server administrator) – a person
    responsible for managing the central server.

-   **Configuration source** – a component (HTTP server) managed by the
    central server or the configuration proxy that distributes global
    configuration.

    configuration from configuration source(s).
