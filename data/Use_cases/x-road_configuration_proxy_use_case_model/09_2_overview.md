## 2 Overview

The configuration proxy acts as an intermediary between X-Road servers
in the matters of global configuration exchange.

The goal of the configuration proxy is to download an X-Road global
configuration from a provided configuration source and further
distribute it in a secure way.

The configuration proxy can be configured to mediate several global
configurations (from multiple configuration sources).
