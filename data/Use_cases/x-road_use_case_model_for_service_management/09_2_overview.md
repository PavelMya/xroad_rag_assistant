## 2 Overview

There are two possibilities for access rights management in a security
server:

-   access rights management based on service clients – it is possible
    to view, add and remove access rights granted for a local access
    rights group, a global access rights group or a subsystem.

-   access rights management based on services – it is possible to view,
    add and remove access rights granted to a service.

To facilitate the management of service access rights for a group of
X-Road subsystems that use the same services, it is possible to create a
local access rights group in a security server. The access rights
granted for a group apply for all the members of the group.

Similarly, in central server, it is possible to create a global access
rights group for a group of X-Road subsystems that use the same services
(for example local authorities).

A local group can only be used to manage the service access rights of
one security server client in one security server. The global groups can
be used by all the security server clients in all the security servers.
