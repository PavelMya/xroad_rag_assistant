### 4.5 Use of Query Parameters

The use of query parameters in the X-Road REST service calls is supported. The query parameters need be encoded
\[[PERCENT-ENCODING](#Ref_PERCENTENC)\] by the consumer information system as described in \[[RFC3986](#Ref_RFC3986)\].
The query parameters MUST be passed unmodified through the X-Road Security Servers to the provider service.
