### 2.13 SERVICE

Service provided by a security server client. A service record is created when the administrator adds or refreshes a WSDL of a security server client, and a new service description is found in the WSDL. The record is modified if the administrator edits the service parameters in the user interface. The record is deleted when the administrator deletes the WSDL containing the service description or when the administrator deletes the security server client owning the WSDL.
