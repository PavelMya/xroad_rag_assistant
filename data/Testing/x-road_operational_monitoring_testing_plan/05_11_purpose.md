### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the levels and procedures of testing used during the development of the operational monitoring components of the X-Road system. While the testing strategy of the development project (\[[TEST-OPMONSTRAT](#TEST-OPMONSTRAT)\]) describes the overall approach to testing, this plan offers a more technical and detailed view of the testing levels, the tools used and the functionality covered by testing.
