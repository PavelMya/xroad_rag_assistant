## 3 Testability of the System

The operational monitoring system is a machine-to-machine data exchange system, and the events that are relevant to monitoring can be triggered programmatically, once the necessary configuration has been carried out. Thus, the system lends itself very well to automated testing.

Regular X-Road message exchange as well as monitoring data exchange via all the required paths can be simulated for both integration and load testing. Because all the relevant configuration will be implemented as text files, modifying the configuration of the monitoring system can be scripted easily, if necessary.
