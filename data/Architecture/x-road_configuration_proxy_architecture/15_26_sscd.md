### 2.6 SSCD

The SSCD (Secure Signature Creation Device) is an optional hardware component that provides secure cryptographic signature creation capability to the signer.

The SSCD needs to be a PKCS \#11 (see \[[PKCS11](#Ref_PKCS11)\]) compliant hardware device that can be optionally used by the configuration proxy for signing the generated global configuration files it generates. The use of the interface requires that a PKCS \#11 compliant device driver is installed and configured in the configuration proxy system.
