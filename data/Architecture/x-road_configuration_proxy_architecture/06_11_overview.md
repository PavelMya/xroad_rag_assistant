### 1.1 Overview

The configuration proxy acts as an intermediary between X-Road servers in the matters of global configuration exchange.

The goal of the configuration proxy is to download an X-Road global configuration from a provided configuration source and further distribute it in a secure way. Optionally, the downloaded global configuration may be modified to suit the requirements of the configuration proxy owner.

The configuration proxy can be configured to mediate several global configurations (from multiple configuration sources).
