## 18 Privacy

Security best practice supports and facilitates privacy best practice. Privacy involves Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which is any data (including IP addresses) that allow the identification of a person, any data that the person has disclosed to an X-Road operator, or the person’s or other person’s data that are in their possession, including Personal data. 

X-Road is obligated to comply with the General Protection Data Regulation (GDPR) that stipulates how personal data must be processed in any operation performed on personal data, including collection, recording, organization, storage, alteration, disclosure, granting access to personal data, consultation and retrieval, use of personal data, communication, cross-usage, combination, closure, erasure, destruction, or several of the aforementioned operations, regardless of the manner in which the operations are carried out or the means used.

When GDPR (or any other rule/regulation) must be applied, an X-Road member organisation is responsible for maintaining and operating its Security Server(s) in a manner that is compliant with the rule/regulation.
