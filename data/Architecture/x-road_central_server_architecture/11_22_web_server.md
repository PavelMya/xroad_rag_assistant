### 2.2 Web Server

The global configuration files generated by the Central Server need to be made available to configuration clients. The HTTP-based protocol used for downloading configuration is described in \[[PR-GCONF](#Ref_PR-GCONF)\]. Technically, the configuration consists of a set of files that are shared out using standard web server (nginx\[[2](#Ref_2)\] web server is used). The global configuration generation is handled by the management services component.
