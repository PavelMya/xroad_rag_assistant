### 5.2 Redundant Deployment

The availability of the entire system can be increased with the use of redundancy. The information system can be connected to multiple security servers through a load balancer to evenly distribute the load. If multiple security servers provide the service requested by the service client, then the service client's security server will choose the first available service provider's security server when forwarding the request. Thus, redundancy is inherent to the X-Road message transport protocol, provided that there are multiple security servers configured to offer the same service.
