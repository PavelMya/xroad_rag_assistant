### 4.1 Management Services

The management services are called by security servers to perform management tasks such as registering a security server client or deleting an authentication certificate.

The management service interface is a synchronous RPC-style interface that is required by the security server. The service is provided by central servers.

The interface is described in more detail in \[[ARC-G](#Ref_ARC-G)\], \[[PR-MSERV](#Ref_PR-MSERV)\].
