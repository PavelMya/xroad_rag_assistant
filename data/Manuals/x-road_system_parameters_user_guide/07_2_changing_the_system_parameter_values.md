## 2 Changing the System Parameter Values

The system parameters specify various characteristics of the system, such as port numbers, timeouts and paths to files on disk. The system parameters of the X-Road components are mainly stored in configuration files. Additionally, X-Road central server stores some system parameters in the database.

**Changing the values of the system parameters is strongly discouraged, since it may cause unexpected system behaviour.**
