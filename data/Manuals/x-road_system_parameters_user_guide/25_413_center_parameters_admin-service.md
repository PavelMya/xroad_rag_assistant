Misuse of the global configuration generation interval may hinder the operation of the whole X-Road instance. <br /><br />The configuration generation interval must be shorter than the value of global configuration expiration interval (`confExpireIntervalSeconds`), or else the configuration downloaded by the configuration clients (Security Servers or Configuration Proxies) will always expire before valid configuration becomes available. It is highly recommended that the global configuration generation interval is multiple times smaller than the global configuration expiration interval. |
