It is strongly recommended to protect the Central Server from unwanted access using a firewall (hardware or software based). The firewall can be applied to both incoming and outgoing connections depending on the security requirements of the environment where the Central Server is deployed. It is recommended to allow incoming traffic to specific ports only from explicitly defined sources using IP filtering. **Special attention should be paid with the firewall configuration since incorrect configuration may leave the Central Server vulnerable to exploits and attacks.**
