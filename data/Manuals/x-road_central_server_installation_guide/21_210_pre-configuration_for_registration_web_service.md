### 2.10 Pre-configuration for Registration Web Service

The registration web service is installed by package `xroad-center-registration-service`. The package is included in the Central Server installation by default.

Configuration parameters for registration web service are specified in the [UG-SYSPAR](#Ref_UG-SYSPAR) section "Registration service parameters".

**Note:** With new registration service, a maximum size limit (MAX_REQUEST_SIZE = 100 KB) is set for the authentication certificate SOAP message.
