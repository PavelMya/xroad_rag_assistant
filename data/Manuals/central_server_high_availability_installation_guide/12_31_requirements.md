### 3.1 Requirements

The nodes must meet all the requirements listed in the X-Road Central Server Installation Guide (see \[[IG-CS](#Ref_IG-CS)\]). 
Additionally, creating an HA setup requires that all nodes can access the shared configuration database. A PostgreSQL (version 9.4 or newer) compatible database is required.
