### 3.1 Configuring the Signing Key and Certificate for the Security Server Owner

The signing keys used by the Security Servers for signing X-Road messages can be stored on software or hardware based (a Hardware Security Module or a smartcard) security tokens, according to the security policy of the X-Road instance.

Depending on the certification policy, the signing keys are generated either in the Security Server or by the certification service provider. Sections [3.1.1](#311-generating-a-signing-key-and-certificate-signing-request) and [3.1.2](#312-importing-a-certificate-from-the-local-file-system) describe the actions necessary to configure the signing key and certificate in case the key is generated in the Security Server. Section [3.1.3](#313-importing-a-certificate-from-a-security-token) describes the importing of the signing key and certificate in case the key is generated by the certification service provider.

The **background colors** of the devices, keys and certificate are explained in Section [5.1](#51-availability-states-of-security-tokens).
