### 16.2 Usage via JMX API

Environmental monitoring provides also a standard JMX endpoint which can be accessed with any JMX client (for example Java's jconsole application). See \[[ARC-ENVMON](#Ref_ARC-ENVMON)\] for details.

JMX is disabled on default. JMX is enabled by adding standard JMX-related options to the executable java process as in example by \[[ZABBIX-JMX](#Ref_ZABBIX-JMX)\].
