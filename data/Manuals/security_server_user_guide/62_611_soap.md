#### 6.1.1 SOAP

When a new WSDL file is added, the Security Server reads service information from it and displays the information in the table of services. The service code, title and address are read from the WSDL.

**To add a WSDL**, follow these steps.

1.  Navigate to **CLIENTS** tab, click the name of the client for which you wish to add WSDL to and click the **SERVICES** tab.

3.  Click **ADD WSDL**, enter the WSDL address in the dialog that opens and click **ADD**. Once the window is closed, the WSDL and the information about the services it contains are added to the client. By default, the WSDL is added in disabled state (see [6.3](#63-enabling-and-disabling-a-service-description)).

**To see a list of services contained in the WSDL**

-   click the caret next to the WSDL service url to expand the list.
