## 2. Overview

This document describes the external load balancing support features implemented by X-Road and the steps necessary to
configure Security Servers to run as a cluster where each node has an identical configuration, including their keys and
certificates. X-Road Security Server configuration changes are handled by a single primary server and one or more secondary
servers.

Chapter [3. X-Road Installation and configuration](#3-x-road-installation-and-configuration) describes the installation
on a high level and as a whole. The later chapters cover the details of the different parts of the installation and configuration.
The last chapter briefly describes how the configuration can be verified.
