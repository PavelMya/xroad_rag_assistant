### 2.1 Prerequisites to Installation

There are multiple alternatives how the Security Server can be deployed. The options are described in [Annex C Deployment Options](#annex-c-deployment-options).

The Security Server is officially supported on the following platforms:

* Ubuntu Server 22.04 and 24.04 Long-Term Support (LTS) operating system on a x86-64 platform.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 and 9 on a x86-64 platform. See [IG-SS-RHEL](ig-ss_x-road_v6_security_server_installation_guide_for_rhel.md) for more information.

The software can be installed both on physical and virtualized hardware (of the latter, Xen and Oracle VirtualBox have been tested).
