### 4.2 Configuring the Management Service Provider

The Central Server provides management services to the Security Servers that are part of the (local) X-Road infrastructure (see Chapter 6).

A subsystem of an X-Road member acting as a service provider for the management services must be appointed in the Central Server (see 4.2.1), registered as a client of the management services’ Security Server (see 4.2.2) and configured to provide the services in the management services’ Security Server (see 4.2.3).

The management services’ Security Server must be installed and registered in the Central Server before the management service provider can be registered as a client of the Security Server and the management services can be configured (see [SSI](#13-references)).
