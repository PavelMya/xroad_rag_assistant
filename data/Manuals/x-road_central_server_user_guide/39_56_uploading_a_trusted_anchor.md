Access rights: Security Officer

To upload a trusted anchor, follow these steps.

1. In the Navigation tabs, select Global Configuration and select the Trusted Anchors sub-tab.
2. Click Upload button, find the external configuration anchor received from a federation partner and click Open.
3. Verify the integrity of the anchor file by comparing the displayed anchor file hash value with the hash value provided by the federation partner and confirm the anchor upload by clicking Confirm.

In case a previous anchor from the same federation partner has been uploaded to the system, the new anchor will replace the old one.
