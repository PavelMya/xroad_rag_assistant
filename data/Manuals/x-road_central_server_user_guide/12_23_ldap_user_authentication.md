### 2.3 LDAP user authentication

X-Road leverages PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for user authentication, which facilitates LDAP integration.

A detailed setup guide can be found under security server user guide [2.3 LDAP user authentication](ug-ss_x-road_6_security_server_user_guide.md#23-ldap-user-authentication).
Please note that X-Road property path will be different in case of Central Server. Refer to [ug-syspar_x-road_v6_system_parameters.md](ug-syspar_x-road_v6_system_parameters.md#413-center-parameters-admin-service) for relevant properties.
