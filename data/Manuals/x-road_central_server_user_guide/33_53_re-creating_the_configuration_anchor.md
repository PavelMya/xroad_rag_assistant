### 5.3 Re-Creating the Configuration Anchor

Access rights: Security Officer

Normally, the configuration anchors are generated (and in an HA setup, distributed to every node) automatically by the system upon changes in the data included in the anchor (one or more Central Server addresses, signing keys). The re-creation of an anchor is necessary mostly for recovering from error situations.

To re-create an anchor, follow these steps.

1. In the Navigation tabs, select Global Configuration and select either the Internal Configuration or External Configuration sub-tab, as appropriate.
2. In the Anchor section, click Re-create.
