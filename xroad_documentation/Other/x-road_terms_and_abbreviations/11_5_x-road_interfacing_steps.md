## 5 X-Road interfacing steps

**Affiliation of membership** – a process ending with becoming a member of X-Road. Becoming a member requires conclusion of affiliation contract and registration of data of the member (name and ID of the member) in X-Road central server. Requirements for affiliation are established by X-Road governing authority with relevant regulation/affiliation conditions

**Dataservice interfacing** – a process, where a member of X-Road creates organizational and technical capacity for offering or using dataservice. Interfacing includes development of the service by the member as well as its setup in security server, conclusion of service usage contracts and granting access rights. In order to use the service, service provider, as well as service client, shall undergo interfacing.

**Interaction** – activation procedure of dataservice (single use), bilateral information exchange through dataservice, i.e. request of dataservice by the service client by sending a request, to which the service provider will send a response.

**Registration of security server** – a process, where organizational and technical capacity of a member of X-Road is created to enable contacting the information system of the member of X-Road via X-Road. The result is a member of X-Road, with whom a secure data exchange channel of X-Road can be established. To ensure this, at least one security server shall be bound to the member in the central server.

**Registration of subsystem** – a process for establishing organizational and technical capacity to distinguish organizational users or user groups on the level of a subsystem. Technically, subsystems shall be registered as security server clients.
