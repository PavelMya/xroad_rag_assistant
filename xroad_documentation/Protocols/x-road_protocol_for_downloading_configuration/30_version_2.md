            Set of configuration parameters that are
                used only by members of this X-Road instance.
            
        
    
    
        
            Information about a source of
                configuration.
            
        
    

    
        
            
                
                    Code that uniquely identifies this
                        instance of the X-Road system within a
                        federation of systems.
                    
                
            
            
                
                    Information about a source of
                        configuration.
                    
                
            
            
                
                    Parameters of management services
                        called by the security servers.
                    
                
            
            
                
                    Time interval (in seconds) after
                        which a logged signature should be
                        time-stamped. This ensures that the
                        time-stamped signature can be used as evidence
                        at some later date.

                        authenticate TLS connection to the
                        authentication certificate registration
                        service.

                    Code of the X-Road instance that
                        provides configuration to this configuration
                        source.
