### 2.2 Added `securityServer` element
A new `securityServer` element was added to identify the specific target security server.

```xml
 
        
            Identifies a specific security server
        
    
```
  The element is of the type `XRoadSecurityServerIdentifierType`, which is one of the identifiers already defined
  in the X-Road Message Protocol v 4.0 \[[PR-MESS](#Ref_PR-MESS)\] section 2.1. The whole XML schema for the identifier types is defined in
  Annex A of the same document. The relevant part is listed below for convenience.

```xml

    
        
            
                
                
                
                
            
            
        
    

```
