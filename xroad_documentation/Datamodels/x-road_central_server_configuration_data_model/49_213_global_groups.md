### 2.13 GLOBAL_GROUPS

Global group of access rights subjects that can be added to access control lists at Security Servers.

The record is created when a new global group needs to be added to the X-Road instance. Then an X-Road registration officer adds new global group in the user interface. The record is modified when the group description is edited or members are added to or removed from the group by an Xâ€‘Road registration officer in the user interface. The record is deleted when the global group is deleted in the user interface by an X-Road registration officer.
