### 3.1 Actors

The use case model for the X-Road configuration proxy includes the
following actors.

-   **CP administrator** – Configuration proxy administrator – a person
    responsible for managing the configuration proxy.

-   **Configuration client** – System acting as a configuration client.
    Can either be a security server or another configuration proxy.

-   **Configuration source** – a component (HTTP server) that
    distributes global configuration and is managed by the central
    server or another configuration proxy.

Relationships between the actors, the system and the use cases are
described in Figure 1.
