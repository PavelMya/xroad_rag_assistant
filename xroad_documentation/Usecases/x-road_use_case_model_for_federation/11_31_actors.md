### 3.1 Actors

The use case model for the federation of X-Road systems includes the
following actors.

-   **CS administrator** (central server administrator) – a person
    responsible for managing the central server.

-   **Configuration source** – a component (HTTP server) managed by the
    central server or the configuration proxy that distributes external
    configuration.

Relationships between the actors, the systems and the use cases are
described in Figure 1.
