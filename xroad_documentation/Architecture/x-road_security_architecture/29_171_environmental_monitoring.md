### 17.1 Environmental Monitoring
   
Environmental monitoring provides details of the Security Servers such as operating system, memory, disk space, CPU load, running processes, installed packages, X-Road version information etc.

It is possible to limit the environmental monitoring data set that is returned to the central monitoring client. The limited data set includes certificate, operating system and X-Road version information.
