## 2 Environment Assumptions

X-Road facilitates a data bridge infrastructure between a variety of organisational actors, such as government registers, financial institutions, and telecommunications service providers. X-Road is therefore a critical information infrastructure (CII) system essential for the operation and sustainability of data exchange between such X-Road member organisations. Disruption of CII may be caused by a variety of human-induced actions or technical failures. 

X-Road security is therefore designed with CII-equivalence resilience in mind. Organisations must register with and be affiliated to X-Road, and acquire identity and signing certificates and keys, before they can perform data exchange.
