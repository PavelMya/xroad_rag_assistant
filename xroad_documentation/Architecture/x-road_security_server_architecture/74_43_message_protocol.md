### 4.3 Message Protocol

The X-Road Message Protocol is used by service client and service provider information systems for communicating with the X-Road security server.

X-Road supports two message protocols: message protocol for SOAP and message protocol for REST. Both protocols are synchronous, and they're initiated by the client IS or by the service provider's security server.

The interface is described in more detail in \[[ARC-G](#Ref_ARC-G)\], \[[PR-MESS](#Ref_PR-MESS)\], \[[PR-REST](#Ref_PR-REST)\].
