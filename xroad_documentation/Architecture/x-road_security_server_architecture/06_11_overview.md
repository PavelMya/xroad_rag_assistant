### 1.1 Overview

The main function of a security server is to mediate requests between a service client and a service provider. Both the client and the provider communicate with the security server that is connected to their information system and the secure message exchange between the two parties is then handled by the security servers.

-   Messages transmitted over the public Internet are secured using digital signatures and encryption.

-   The service provider's security server applies access control to incoming messages, thus ensuring that only those users that have signed an appropriate agreement with the service provider can access the data.

The security server also depends on a central server, which provides the global configuration.
