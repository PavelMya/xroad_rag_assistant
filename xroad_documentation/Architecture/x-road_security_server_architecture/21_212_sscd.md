### 2.12 SSCD

The SSCD (Secure Signature Creation Device) is an optional hardware component that provides secure cryptographic signature creation capability to the signer.

The SSCD needs to be a PKCS \#11 (see \[[PKCS11](#Ref_PKCS11)\]) compliant hardware device that can be optionally used by the security server for signing messages that it exchanges. The use of the interface requires that a PKCS \#11 compliant device driver is installed and configured in the security server system.

### 2.13 Environmental Monitoring Service

Provides methods that can be used by X-Road participants to get environmental data of the security server. It requests the data from the local monitoring service via gRPC interface and translates it to a SOAP XML response.

The component is a proxy addon.

### 2.14 Monitor

Monitor component collects environmental monitoring information such as running processes, available disk space, installed packages etc. The monitoring data is published via gRPC and (optional) JMX interfaces.

The component is a separate daemon process.
