### 4.6 Downloading Signed Documents

The service for downloading signed documents can be used by the information systems to download signed containers from the security server's message log. The containers can be transferred to third parties and verified offline. In addition, the service provides a convenience method for downloading global configuration that can be used to verify the signed containers.

The protocol is a synchronous RPC-style protocol that is initiated by the IS.

The interface is described in more detail in \[[ARC-G](#Ref_ARC-G)\].
