### 4.7 TSP

The Time-Stamp Protocol (see \[[TSP](#Ref_TSP)\]) is used by security servers to ensure long-term proof value of the exchanged messages. The security servers log all the messages and their signatures. These logs are periodically time-stamped to create long-term proof.

The Time-Stamp Protocol is a synchronous protocol provided by the timestamp authority.

The interface is described in more detail in \[[ARC-G](#Ref_ARC-G)\].
