## 1 Introduction

X-Road central and security servers keep audit log. The audit log events are generated by user interfaces when the user
changes system state or configuration. Additionally, the utility `signer-console` generates audit log events. The user
actions are logged regardless of whether the outcome was a success or a failure.

This document provides complete list of all audit log events and theirs related data sets.
