### 3.2 General Configuration

Modify '/etc/xroad/conf.d/local.ini' to contain the following:

```ini
[configuration-proxy]

; Address of the webserver serving the distributed configuration
; address=
```

The configuration of this parameter is necessary for generating a correctly formatted configuration anchor file that will need to be uploaded to Central Servers that should receive configurations mediated by this proxy, this process is described in detail in [3.4](#34-proxy-instance-configuration). There are several more system parameters that can be configured in '/etc/xroad/conf.d/local.ini' under the 'configuration-proxy' section, their descriptions and default values can be seen from the following table:

| Parameter                     | Default value                                               | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| address                       | 0.0.0.0                                                     | The public IP or NAT address (reference data: 1.5) which can be accessed for downloading the distributed global configurations.                                                                                                               |
| configuration-path            | /etc/xroad/confproxy/                                       | Absolute path to the directory containing the configuration files of the proxy instance. The format of the configuration directory is described in [3.2.1](#321-configuration-structure-of-the-instances).                                    |
| generated-conf-path           | /var/lib/xroad/public                                       | Absolute path to the public web server directory where the global configuration files generated by this Configuration Proxy, should be placed for distribution.                                                                               |
| signature-digest-algorithm-id | SHA-512                                                     | ID of the digest algorithm the Configuration Proxy should use when computing global configuration signatures. The possible values are: *SHA-256*, *SHA-384*, *SHA-512*.                                                                       |
| hash-algorithm-uri            | http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha512                     | URI identifying the algorithm the Configuration Proxy should use to calculate hash values for the global configuration file. The possible values are:http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256,http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha512. |
| download-script               | /usr/share/xroad/scripts/download_instance_configuration.sh | Absolute path to the location of the script that initializes the global configuration download procedure.                                                                                                                                     |

The Configuration Proxy is periodically started by a cron job. It reads the properties described above, from the configuration file before executing each proxy instance configured in 'configuration-path', generating new global configuration directories using algorithms as defined by 'signature-digest-algorithm-id' and 'hash-algorithm-uri'. The generated directories are subsequently placed in 'generated-conf-path' for distribution.
