### 2.11 Installing the Support for Environmental Monitoring

The support for environmental monitoring functionality on a Security Server is provided by package xroad-monitor that is installed by default. The package installs and starts the `xroad-monitor` process that will gather and make available the monitoring information.

During the Security Server initial configuration, the server’s X-Road membership information and the software token’s PIN are set.

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Configuring the Security Server assumes that the Security Server owner is a member of the X-Road.
