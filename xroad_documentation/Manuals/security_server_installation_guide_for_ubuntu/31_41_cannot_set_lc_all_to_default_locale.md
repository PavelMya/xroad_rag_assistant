### 4.1 Cannot Set LC\_ALL to Default Locale

If running the locale command results in the error message

    locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory,

then the support for this particular language has not been installed. To install it, run the command (the example uses the English language):

    sudo apt-get install language-pack-en

Then, to update the system’s locale files, run the following commands (the example uses the US locale):

    sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
    sudo update-locale en_US.UTF-8

Set operating system locale. Add following line to `/etc/environment` file:

    LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

After updating the system’s locale settings, it is recommended to restart the operating system.
