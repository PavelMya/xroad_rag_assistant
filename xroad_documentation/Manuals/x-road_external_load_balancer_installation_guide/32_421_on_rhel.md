#### 4.2.1 on RHEL

On RHEL, we assume that the PostgreSQL default configuration files are located in the `PGDATA` directory `/var/lib/pgsql/serverconf`.
>**Note:** If the location is different in your system (for example `/var/lib/pgsql/13/serverconf`), then directory `/var/lib/pgsql/serverconf` need to be replaced with your data directory (for example `/var/lib/pgsql/13/serverconf`) in the following scripts.
