### 7.7 Changing the Owner of Security Server

Access rights: Registration Officer

The actions required to change a Security Server's owner depend on whether automatic approval of Security Server owner change requests is enabled or disabled (_default_).

When automatic approval of Security Server owner change requests is enabled, the following action must be taken:
- A Security Server owner change request must be sent from the Security Server to the Central Server by the Security Server administrator.

Automatic approval of Security Server owner change requests is disabled by default. In that case, to change the owner of a Security Server, the following action must be taken.
- A Security Server owner change request must be sent from the Security Server to the Central Server by the Security Server administrator.
- The requests must be approved or declined by the Central Server administrator.

To approve/decline a request, it can be done either through in the Management request view list or in the Management request details view.
