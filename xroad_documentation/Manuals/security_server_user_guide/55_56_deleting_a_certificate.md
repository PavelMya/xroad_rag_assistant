### 5.6 Deleting a Certificate

An authentication certificate registered or submitted for registration in the X-Road governing authority (indicated by the "Registered" or "Registration in progress" state) must be unregistered before it can be deleted. The unregistering event sends an authentication certificate deletion request from the Security Server to the Central Server.
