## 4 Security Server Clients

**Important: to use or provide X-Road services, a Security Server client needs to be certified by a certification service provider approved by the X-Road governing authority, and the association between the client and the Security Server used by the client must be registered at the X-Road governing authority.**

**This section does not address managing the owner to a Security Server.** The owner's information has been already added to the Security Server upon the installation, and registered upon the Security Server's registration. The owner's registration status can be looked up by selecting **CLIENTS** on the main menu. In the list the item with text "(Owner)" after the name is Security Server's owner. Before the registration of the Security Server, the owner is in the "Saved" state and after the completion of the registration process, in the "Registered" state.

The registration of the Security Server's owner does not extend to the owner's subsystems. The subsystems must be registered as individual clients.
