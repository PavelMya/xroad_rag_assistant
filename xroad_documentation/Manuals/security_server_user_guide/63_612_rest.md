#### 6.1.2 REST

After a new REST service is added, the Security Server displays text "REST" and url for that service.

**To add a REST service**, follow these steps.

1.  Navigate to **CLIENTS** tab, click the name of the client for which you wish to add REST service to and click the **SERVICES** tab.

3.  Click **ADD REST**. Select whether the URL type is "REST API Base Path" or "OpenAPI 3 Description". Enter the url and service code in the window that opens and click **ADD**.

4.  Once the window is closed, the url and the service code are added to the service list. If the added URL type was OpenAPI 3 description, the service description is parsed and endpoints are added under the service. By default, the REST service is added in disabled state (see [6.3](#63-enabling-and-disabling-a-service-description)).

**To see the service details under the REST service**

-   click the caret on the REST service description row to expand the service details.
