### 2.2 Configuring password policies

Configuring a password policy in your Admin UI authentication will provide an additional layer of defence against password guessing attacks, such as password spraying.

User account passwords cannot be changed directly from the Admin UI, therefore the password policy must be configured on operating system user account level. 
The method of adding a new password policy varies significantly depending on your operating system, existing PAM configuration and authentication protocol.

For instruction on how to add password policies, please refer to your operating system's official documentation or customer support.
